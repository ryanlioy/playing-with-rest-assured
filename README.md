I made this repo without any knowledge of what Rest Assured is. It is pretty simply
so this is somewhat pointless aside from proof that I have actually used it.

The API used is the free version of [reqres.in](reqres.in). If you for some reason want to run this yourself
place the API key in src/test/resources/key.txt.
